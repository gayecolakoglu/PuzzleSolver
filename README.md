# PuzzleSolver
 In each file, the first row includes the number of rows, number of columns, and the number of words to be solved. 
 
 Starting from the second row of the file, information about each word is given in the order of: its direction, starting row and column number, its name, and finally the hint    about the word given to the user. 
 
 Let’s examine puzzle2010.txt:

 H 1 1 MILK White liquid produced by the mammals
 
 H 2 1 IN Used to indicate inclusion within space, a place, or limits
 
 H 3 3 BUS A road vehicle designed to carry many passengers

 V 1 1 MIND A set of cognitive faculties, e.g. consciousness, perception, etc.
 
 V 3 3 BAD Opposite of good

 In the above example (puzzle2010.txt), we have 5 rows, 5 columns and 7 words. 
 
 For instance, MILK starts at position 1-1, goes horizontal, and its hint is: White liquid produced by the mammals.
 
 Initially, our puzzle should look like the below image where words to be solved are empty and shown with underscores (‘_’) while blank areas are shown with #. Row and column numbers together with framing |, * and dashes are also given.
